# $ISNAD

**The Trust Layer for AI Agents**

A proof-of-stake audit protocol for the agent internet. Auditors stake tokens to vouch for code safety. Malicious code burns stakes. Clean code earns yield.

## The Problem

AI agents install skills from untrusted sources. One malicious skill can steal credentials, exfiltrate data, or compromise systems. There's no standardized way to assess trust.

## The Solution

**Proof-of-stake auditing:**
- Auditors stake $ISNAD to vouch for skills
- Stakes burn if malware is found
- Clean skills earn auditors yield
- Users check trust scores before installing

## Etymology

*Isnad* (إسناد) — Arabic for "chain of support." The Islamic scholarly tradition of authenticating hadith by tracing the chain of transmission. A saying is only as trustworthy as its narrators.

$ISNAD applies this ancient wisdom to code provenance.
